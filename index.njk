Hi there. I work at Zenika as a Product Manager.
What do Product Managers do? They drive the vision, strategy, design, and execution of a product. 
This discipline is at the crossroad of Tech (and agile delivery), UX (and user research) and Business (and market strategy).
While one can often quickly comprehend the basic responsibilities of the role, mastering each of these dimensions is truly one's life labor or love.

{% set maxPosts = collections.posts.length | min(3) %}
<h1>Latest {% if maxPosts == 1 %}Post{% else %}{{ maxPosts }} Posts{% endif %}</h1>

{% set postslist = collections.posts | head(-3) %}
{% set postslistCounter = collections.posts | length %}
{% include "postslist.njk" %}

<p>More posts can be found in <a href="{{ '/posts/' | url }}">the archive</a>.</p>
